- Some questions about the topics covered in the course

## Origin of Robots

- Rossum's Universal Robots (1920)
- Robbie (1939)
- Runaround (1942)

## Asimov's laws of robotics:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must project its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

## Robots in movies

In most movies, robots are evil. Like the Terminator. However, they can also be good, like Wall-E and R2D2.

They are also highly sophisticated.

In reality, robots are not that sophisticated (yet).

They are mostly about automation and making things easier.

## Robots from the Industrial Revolution

- Power loom (1733)
- Steam engine (1760)
- Worm gear (1774)
- Mass production (1908)
- Henry Ford's car factory

## Origin of robots

- First robot introduced at General Motors in 1961.

## Robots in 2005

- A lot of tasks were automated using robots
- But the **remaining tasks are tough to solve by robots**
- Existing solutions were very expensive
  - Robot: 300.000 DKK
  - System integration: 1.000.000 DKK

This is why Universal Robots was founded.

## Universal Robots - 2005 - Collaborative robot era

- Focus: Low weight, low cost, easy to use
- This was the start of the **collaborative robot era**

# Artificial brains

- Wiener, Turing, Neumann, McCulloch - The fathers of computer science
- "You can make computers that can simulate brain functions"

## Shakey - SRI - 1966 - 1972

- First robot to embody artificial intelligence

## Illustrative game (jeg var med)

- The difficulty of coordination between sensors, motors and controller became very apparent

## Basics

- Make the robot body fit the task as much as possible, then you will need as little intelligence as possible.

## One limiation of robots

- Huge explosion has happened with the development of computers, but not with robots
- Power consumption is a huge limitation
- Battery technology has not evolved as much as computers

## Examples of advanced robots
- Mobile Robots: Mobile Industrial Robots (Odense)
  - Regnar
  - Was removed because the elderly were scared of the robot
  - Safety issues at Herlev (going around corners)
  - The human aspect is very important: **How will the robot fit into our world?**

- Lab automation: Flow Robotics A/S (Nord vest KÃ¸benhavn)

- Underwater robots:
  - Does not need to fight gravity, so they can swim around for a long time
  - Scarlet Knight was a submarine robot that crossed the pacific ocean from New Jersey to Balona, Spain
- In the air
  - Drones
- On land
  - Walking robots
  - Self driving cars
- On humans
  - Prostetics
- Service robots (Vacuum, mowing, gutter cleaning)
- Mars rovers
- Search and rescue




## Exercises

Task 1: Build a robot that can move to a certain spot and a specific orientation.



Group 4 / JoMaMa

## Lecture 1.2 - Thursday, 29/08/2024

What you have to worry about when solving the task:
- Precision
- Control
- Model: the model of the world
  - Precision of measurements
- Environment: external factors that affect the robot
- Actuator noise: the actuators are not perfect and will not always do exactly what you tell it to
- Mechanics of the robot: the robot is not perfect, wheels might compress and affect your model
  - Actuator type
  - Play / wiggle room of the mechanics
- More resolution: how precisely can you control the motor?
  - Smaller wheels will give you more resolution
- Power source
  - Do we give the robot the correct amount of power?
- Sampling rate
  - How often can the robot get new instructions?
- Inertia
  - How fast can the robot change direction?
  - Controlled by weight and speed

# Lecture 2.2 - Thursday, 05/09/2024

## Behavior based control

Classic control: Sense $\rightarrow$ Plan $\rightarrow$ Act

Behavior based control: Perception $\rightarrow$ Response

- We can build a robot by combining simple behaviors

Example: Roomba

Behaviors:
- Spiraling
- Wall following
- Room crossing (ant line, random walk)
- Dirt detection

Sensors:
- Cliff sensor (IR) - detects the edge of a cliff
  - Limitations: Couldn't clean black carpets, as the robot thought it was a cliff
- Virtual Wall / Home base: Infrared light that the robot can detect to get back to the charging station
- Wall: Infrared light that the robot can detect to follow the wall
- Wheel drop sensors: Detects if the robot is stuck or if the wheels are not touching the ground or if the robot is picked up
  - Very simple and reliable, just a switch
- Bump: Detects if the robot has bumped into something
  - Big plastic bumper that pushes in when it hits something
- Odometry: Encoders on the wheels to measure how far the robot has moved
- Dirt: Acoustic impact sensor (noise)

## Simple behaviors

Simple is always better
- Robust
- Cheap
- Easy to understand
- No goal
- Can be just a few lines of code

Should the robot close its eyes when turning in an intersection?
- Maybe, to avoid interference from the behaviors

Behaviors are modular

## Behavior coordination

- They cannot all control the robot at the same time
- Should they compete or cooperate?
  - Compete: The strongest behavior wins
  - Cooperate: The behaviors can work together

- A competitive method: Priority based coordination: The behaviors are ordered by priority

- Action-selector coordination: Over time, coordinate which behavior is more important

- Voting based coordination: Each behavior votes on what to do
  - If most behaviors vote for the same action, that action is taken

- Fusion-based coordination: Fuse the responses
  - If one behavior says to go left, and another says to go right, the robot goes straight (vector addition)


1. Build a minimal robot system
2. Evaluate the robot
3. Add new behaviors or adjust
  - Software, robot design, sensor locations etc.
4. Evaluate the robot
5. Repeat

## Complex systems

Kismet example

Social human robot

# Lecture 3.1 - Tuesday 10/09/2024 - Hierarchical architectures

## Symbolic-based paradigm

Stuck for several decades in the mindset that we only need better sensors, our model is perfect and our robot is perfect and the world is perfect.

Finally led to hybrid systems.

# Lecture 3.2 - Thursday 12/09/2024 - Hierarchical architectures

# Lecture 4.1 - Tuesday 17/09/2024

Ask these questions when writing the report

- Which assumptions have we done in the design of the robot?
- Which assumptions are we depending on?

- How are we measuring the performance of the robot?
- How is it replicated?

- Distance between sensors
- Photo of the robot
- Geometry of the robot
- Technical drawing of the robot

- Does the results obtained give a fair and realistic picture of the system being studied?
  - How honest are our results?

- Sometimes we have a tendency to do too large conclusions based on too little data
  - Don't overstate the results
  - Be careful with the conclusions

# Lecture 6.1 - Tuesday 01/10/2024

Discretized space: The world is divided into cells

Feature based localization: The robot uses features in the world to localize itself

Problem: The environment is not static

**Belief**: Confidence in the robot's position

What can improve belief?
- Feature extraction
- More sensors

## Particle filtering

- Monte Carlo

- Random sampling



- Why is localization important?
  - To know where the robot is
  - To know where the robot is going
  - To know where the robot has been

- What is belief?
  - The robot's confidence in its position

- How do we prevent errors?

- Exaplain the Particle filtering loop

# Lecture 6.2 - Thursday 03/10/2024

# Lecture 7.1 - Tuesday 08/10/2024

## Belief

- The robot's confidence in its position
- Represented as a probability distribution

## Prior belief

- Prior is the belief *before* incorporate measurements
- Posterior is the belief *after* we have incorporated measurements


## Kalman gain

- How many times do we need to run it?
  - Until we have statistical significance
  - It depends on how confident we want to be

  - We run it until we can say with statistics that it is not caused by randomness

# Lexture 7.2 - Thursday 10/10/2024

<!-- TODO -->

# Lecture 9.1 - Tuesday 22/10/2024

## Problem: Representation of the real world

## Embodied

- The robot is physically moving in the world
- The actions that it takes changes what it sees

## Active

- The robot decides where to go and what to perceive

## Situated

- The robot is in a specific place in the world

## Embodied perception

- Studies have shown that manipulating and changing the world in an active manor improves perception

## Proprioceptive

- Looking inwards

## Exteroceptive

- Looking outwards

## Sensors Limitations
- Error and noise
- Occlusion
- Hardware limitation (e.g. subsonic sounds)

- The robot needs to be able to deal with this

## Percepcual classes

- The robot needs to be able to classify what it sees
- Dark, light instead of raw values
- An abstraction over the sensing

## Light sensors

- Photoresistor
  - More light leads to less resistance and vice versa
  - Very simple $\rightarrow$ very robust
  - Used in heart rate monitors
  - A light is shone on the skin and the photoresistor measures
  - If you shine a different light on it, you can measure the oxygen levels in the blood

## Analog vs digital

- The analog signal is continuous
- The digital signal is discrete

## Shaft Encoders

- An proprioceptive sensor that measures the rotation of the wheel

## Distance sensors

- Ultrasonic Distance sensors ð¦

- We know the speed of sound through air
- We can measure the time it takes for the sound to come back
- Errors:
  - Echo, the sound bounces off something else
  - Temperature, pressure, humidity might affect the speed of sound
- XBOX Kinect (Infrared laser projector + monochrome CMOS sensor)
  - Per pixel depth measurement
  - Was used in robotics for determining where the robot could go

## Cameras


## Laser range sensors

- Errors:
  - At distances, the laser spreads out and the resolution decreases


## Navigation sensors

- GPS
- Beacons (Tile, AirTag)
- Triangulation

## Gravity

- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope


## Main take away:

- Choice of sensor should be driven by scenario and task of the robot

- Never trust the sensors
- Test them


## How do we select the correct sensor?

Considerations
- Target: What do we want to measure?
- Processing: How much data can we handle?
- Time
- Keep it simple
